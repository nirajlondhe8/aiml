# Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Improvement

## Project Overview

This project involves training and evaluating various machine learning models on a dataset from a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. We have implemented several models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and explored methods to improve their performance through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metric adjustments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes:

- **bank-additional-full.csv**: Contains 41,188 examples with 20 input features.
- **bank-additional.csv**: A random 10% subset of the `bank-additional-full.csv`, with 4,119 examples.
- **bank-full.csv**: Contains all examples with 17 input features.
- **bank.csv**: A random 10% subset of the `bank-full.csv`, with 4,119 examples.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Involves training and evaluation of Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Exploration and implementation of additional features to improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation is conducted using accuracy, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python installed and use the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
