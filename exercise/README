# Summary of Key Points

## Year of Make Distribution

- The majority of cars in the dataset were manufactured between 2000 and 2020.

## Fuel Type and Outliers

- Fuel type 2 shows outliers that are evenly distributed between left and right skewness.

## Drive Type and Outliers

- Cars with drive type 0 exhibit right-skewed outliers.

## Odometer Reading and Price

- Odometer reading has the strongest correlation (0.01) with car price among the variables analyzed.

## Year and Price

- Year of manufacture has a relatively strong negative correlation (-0.004) with car price.

## Other Features and Price

- Features like manufacturer, type, cylinders, and drive show similar weak correlations (~0.002) with car price.

## Features with Weak Correlation

- Features such as size, paint color, and region have very weak correlations (~0.001) with car price, suggesting they may not significantly impact pricing decisions.

# Recommendations

## Focus on Odometer and Year

- Given their stronger correlations with price, prioritize these features in pricing and valuation models.

## Consider Outlier Handling

- Develop strategies to handle outliers in fuel type and drive type to improve model accuracy.

## Feature Selection

- Delete features with very weak correlations (e.g., size, paint color, region) from further analysis to streamline modeling efforts.
